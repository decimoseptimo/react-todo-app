# React todo app 

A simple todo SPA made with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 
`todoModel.js` and  `utils.js` were sourced from [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/react).
 
Everything else is from my own authoring.
